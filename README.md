# Final Documentation Project (Twitter standard search API)
Created reference documentation of Twitter's standard search API using MS Word for Writing Documentation for APIs UCR course in which developers can refer to in order to access Twitter data through its APIs (application programming interfaces). 
# Standard Search API
## Resource Description
The Twitter standard search API returns a collection of relevant Tweets that match a specified query. It searches against a sampling of recent Tweets that were published in the past 7 days. Note, Twitter’s search service and, by extension, the Search API is not meant to be an exhaustive source of Tweets. As a result, not all Tweets will be indexed or made available via the search interface.
